Notes:
1. This is a login request
2. The control ID (line 8 before the ý character) - 979697290 - is a random number that will be used by subsequent
   requests along with the token to authenticate the request. Notice that this number is generated by the client in
   this original request, not by the DMI. The DMI does however generate the token.
