Notes:
1. This is a response to a data request - notice line #12 indicates what this is in response to. Also notice
   that the transaction type on line 3 - DAFS - indicates a data response.
2. On an error, such as this, a sub-transaction block will be present - SERRS - and indicate the error.
3. This error will occur with a bad token, but also if the token has expired and means we need to try a login again.
